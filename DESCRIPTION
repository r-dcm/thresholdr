Description: Diagnostic classification models are confirmatory latent class
    models that provide probabilities of proficiency for respondents on each of
    the assessed skills (Bradshaw, 2016 <doi:10.1002/9781118956588.ch13>).
    Often, results based on these models are reported as classifications, using
    0.5 as the probability threshold for classification (Bradshaw & Levy,
    2019 <doi:10.1111/emip.12247>). Instead, we can use resampling methods to
    estimate a different classification threshold that optimizes sensitivity
    and specificity.
